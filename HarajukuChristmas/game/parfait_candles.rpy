    r "I saw this once in a Moi-même-Moitié video where Mana-sama and Aoki Misako made parfait candles!"
    k neutral "Huh? Whozzat again?"
    # reina thinking sprite
    r talking "Mana-sama is that one pretty doll from Malice Mizer...."
    k talking "The real beautiful one with the blue hair and curls?"
    r laughing "Yeah!"
    r smiling "And Aoki is a pretty popular lolita model! Most well known and influential lolita if you ask me."
    r "Ahhhh... I aspire to be like them someday..."
    k smiling "I gotcha! That’s why we gotta get ultra famous from our influencing life."
    r shocked "But they’re like! World-wide famous!"
    k neutral "I dunno if those would count as world-wide."
    r smiling "Everyone knows lolita fashion because of them..."
    r laughing "Even the people overseas!"
    k "Huh..."
    k talking "I always wondered how people overseas knew about lolita fashion..."
    k "I was scrolling Kinsta the other day and saw an American with Yamanba makeup."
    r talking "Woahhh... the influencer pressure is getting close to me!"
    k smiling "Right? Maybe we are a part of spreading the culture."
    r smiling "That’s.. so..."
    r laughing "COOOL!!!"
    "Suddenly, everyone stares at us. We definitely disturbed their candle making peace."
    k talking "We should probably get started on those candles."
    r neutral "I’m down!"

    # parfait candles clerk: c

    c "Welcome in! How many people?"
    r "Two please!"
    c "Right this way."

    # drag and drop mechanic here?

    "Step one: choose the jelly cube like gel wax."

    "I stare long and hard at the various gel wax colors to choose from."
    r "Which jelly cubes...."
    k "I got the blue and purple ones with gel wax."
    r "Then I’ll take the pink and orange ones!"
    # kuma smiling sprite
    k "Those colors kinda remind me of our outfits."

    "Step two: dip the gel wax in glitter and place them in the glass."

    "I carefully dip the jelly cubes into the glitter. The cubes absorb the glitter with its stickiness."
    k "Oh my god... my nails got a bit of glitter on them..."
    r "Are you okay??"
    k "Ya of course, of course! Don’t worry bout’ them."
    r "You sure? Those nails must’ve cost a lot..."
    k "It’s okay! Really."

    "Step three: add melted wax to the glass."

    "The melted wax, which was provided to us by the staff just now, is in a creamer dispenser."
    "I hold the creamer in both of my hands and pour the wax gently into the glass, watching the liquid float down slowly."
    r "It’s like syrup.."
    k "I really want parfaits now."
    r "I get what you mean!"
    k "Can we get parfaits after this...?"
    r "Yeah!!"

    "Step four: Add your color of choice to the wax."

    "The staff hurriedly came over and provided us with dried wax and some color dye."
    "I pick out the pink color dye, while Kuma gets the blue color dye."
    "Now we just have to mix the dye and the dry wax."
    "Swirl swirl swirl...."
    k "This is surprisingly really fun."
    k "Have ya done this before?"
    r "Nope!"
    r "I’m glad the first time I get to make them is with you!"

    "Step five: Create the ice cream scoop."

    "With the dried wax now colored, we have to get it out of the cup (that we just mixed the color in with) and put it in the scooper."
    "I use a popsicle stick and scrape the wax out with it."
    "Kuma looks like she’s having a hard time getting the wax out of the cup.."
    r "Is the cup hard to grasp?"
    k "Hot hot hot!!"
    r "K-kuma?? Did you get burnt??"
    k "Haah..."
    "I don’t see any visible burn marks on Kuma, thankfully."
    k "Can ya help me with this?~"
    r "Right away!"
    "I reach over and use her popsicle stick to get the wax out of the cup. This wax seems a bit harder than mine."
    "I put the wax into the scooper, molding it into an ice cream shape scoop."
    r "It’s kind of difficult to get the wax into the scooper."
    k "You get me..."

    "Step six: Put the ice cream scoops on top."

    "Now that we have our wax ice cream scoops, it’s time to put them into the parfait glass!"
    "Kuma rotates the parfait glass, seemingly proud of her creation."
    k "I’m seeing the vision..."
    r "Right? Right?"
    k "I wouldn’t want to use this as a real candle."
    r "Let’s save it then! As a souvenir for today’s Christmas date!" 

    "Step seven: Place the whipped cream and sprinkles."

    "Note: it is not actually edible whipped cream and sprinkles. Just decorations for the candle!"
    "We swirl (again) around the whipped cream on the sides of the parfait glass and top it off with the sprinkles."
    k "Woahh.. this made me realize that I’ve never really baked anything."
    r "I can teach you!"
    k "Oh really? Thank ya Reina!"
    r "You’d have to take your nails off for that though..."
    k "Yikes... well if it’s for you then I could."

    "Step eight: Add toppings."
    "There’s so many toppings to choose from! From stars, hearts, smileys..."
    k "I got these cute heart ones!"
    r "Me too! ^_^"
    r "Kuma! Get the cherries too!"
    k "Roger that."
    # transition black fade in fade out

    r "It’s done!!"
    "My parfait has pink liquid wax, with a purple scoop! There’s bows, hearts, and bells to show that it’s a one of a kind Christmas parfait."
    k "Cute, cute as always Reina."
    r "^_^"
    r "And let me see yours..."

    # kumas messy ugly parfait candle here
    "A messed up blue parfait candle with mismatched ornaments.. It looks gloomy compared to the one that you made."

    r "Oh my gosh!!"
    r "It’s so so cute!!"

    # writers note: blind leading the blind

    k "Thank ya, thank ya."
    k "I was thinking about Mana-sama while making this. Y’know with the blue and purple."
    r "Huhu~"
    r "You got an eye for style..."
    "I snap some photos of our finished parfait candles. So cute!"
    k "Parfaits now? Pleeease."
    r "Alright, alright!"

    r "I’m stuffed..."
    k "You got the mini parfait though?"
    r "Yeah but there was a lot on it!"
    r "It had twice the amount of strawberries and chocolate that yours had!"
    k "Yeah, yeah... and half the calories of mine apparently."
    r "We could’ve shared!"
