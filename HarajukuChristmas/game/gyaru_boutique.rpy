    # insert store door ringing sound

    r "WOAHHHH!!"
    "Rows holding fluffy accessories and racks with gyaru-like clothing fill the store atmosphere."
    k "I knew you'd like the store."
    r "There is so much in here!"
    k "Oooo~ I've been meaning to show you it. Come on, let's go look over here."

    "We hustle over to a rack containing shoulderless shirts. I can already picture how cute Kuma would look in them."

    r "Wow this shirt looks really pretty! And it's {i}sooo soft.{/i}"
    r "What do you think, Kuma?"
    k "Hm? Let me see."
    # give clothing sound
    k "Wow it really is. I like the texture on it."
    r "That's good! This seems like something that you would wear."
    k "Are ya sure? I wasn't totally set on this one because I already have plenty of shoulderless shirts."
    r "Absolutely! A new shirt changes the base outfit right? So then, you would have a new outfit to accessorize!"
    k "Hmm... you do have a point."
    k "I think I will buy it. I can pair this one with one of my mini skirts."
    r "Yaa~y!"

    "We continue looking through the store, scouting for accessories, skirts, etc."

    r "Sooo.. you come here often with your gyaru friends?"
    k "Yes! Every few months or so we pay the store a visit and buy the newest releases."
    r "That's really nice!"
    r "When was the last time you were here?"
    k "A little while ago actually."
    k "I have a friend who I used to come here often with, but she's been swamped with college work lately so we haven't seen each other in a while."
    r "Oh…that's unfortunate. Hopefully you get to see her sometime soon!"
    k "Me too. Even so, it is nice to visit this boutique again. {w}With you."
    r "Awwww... stop that! You're such a flirt!"

    "We walk around for a bit before landing on a rack of magazines, sorted by genre."

    k "Oh my godd!! I've been looking for these fashion magazines for a while now. I can't believe they had them here."
    r "Ooooo these look interesting..."

    "I scan through the magazines. {w}I notice a particular one and chuckle to myself."

    k "What’s so funny?"
    r "No no, I’m not laughing at you! I’m just remembering our collab back in high school."

    #flashback transition to high school

    "After a long tiring day of school, I've finally made it home..."
    r "Eugh..."
    r "Crap, I forgot I still have to finish that essay!"
    r "Uuu... I have to start now!"

    "After a while of tedious work, I suddenly hear a notification sound from my phone."

    r "Hm?"
    r "HUH???"

    r "I got a DM from Kuma??"
    r "The popular gyaru influencer on Kinsta?? THE Kuma??"
    r "I can’t believe this is happening!!"
    "I close the doc tab (that has my essay due at 11:59PM.)"
    "Work can wait!"

    "Even though we are friends, I'm really scared."
    "I still can't believe I'm friends with Kuma. She's so bold... cute... and fashionable... "
    "I don't want those rumors to mess up the bond that we have."

    # in person at the apartment transition
    r "K-Kuma!"
    k "Reina!"

    "Of course, I scrubbed my room clean like a maniac before she came here."

    k "Woww. Your room is real organized."
    r "Really?? Thank you so much."
    k "Haha! There's no need to thank me."

    "Time flew by as we chatted about many things, like our love for fashion and the fashion magazines we’ve been keeping up with."
    "It got to a point where we also talked about our past, going into how we got into our fashion sub-styles."

    k "I think I gotta head out soon..."
    r "Oh that’s okay! I should probably get to doing my homework."
    k "Well see ya soon."
    r "Byeeeee!"

    # transition AGAIN
    "A few months later..."

    "I rushed back home to finish my homework so that I could call Kuma."
    "I was locked in on a physics question when I heard a buzz from my phone."
